# GreenAI Architecture

## Overview
GreenAI is built using a modern microservices architecture, leveraging cloud-native technologies and blockchain integration. The system is designed to be scalable, maintainable, and secure.

## System Components

### Frontend (React + TypeScript)
- Single Page Application (SPA)
- Redux for state management
- TailwindCSS for styling
- Web3.js for blockchain interactions
- Progressive Web App (PWA) capabilities

### Backend (Node.js + Express)
- RESTful API architecture
- TypeORM for database interactions
- JWT authentication
- Rate limiting and security middleware
- Logging and monitoring

### Smart Contracts (Solana + Rust)
- Environmental action recording
- Token rewards distribution
- Action verification system
- Token management

### Database
- PostgreSQL for relational data
- Redis for caching
- TypeORM migrations and entities

## Infrastructure

### AWS Services
- ECS for container orchestration
- ECR for container registry
- RDS for PostgreSQL
- ElastiCache for Redis
- CloudWatch for monitoring
- Route53 for DNS
- CloudFront for CDN

### DevOps
- GitHub Actions for CI/CD
- Docker for containerization
- Terraform for infrastructure as code
- ELK stack for logging

## Security

### Authentication
- JWT-based authentication
- Wallet signature verification
- Rate limiting
- CORS configuration

### Data Protection
- Data encryption at rest
- SSL/TLS encryption in transit
- Regular security audits
- Automated vulnerability scanning

## Scalability

### Horizontal Scaling
- Container orchestration with ECS
- Load balancing
- Database read replicas
- Caching strategy

### Performance Optimization
- CDN for static assets
- Database indexing
- Query optimization
- Cache management

## Monitoring

- Resource utilization
- User engagement

### Alerting
- CloudWatch alarms
- Error tracking
- Performance monitoring
- Security alerts

## Development Workflow
